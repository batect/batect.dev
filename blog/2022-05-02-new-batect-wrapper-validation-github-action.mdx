title: "New: Batect wrapper validation action"

The [0.79.0 release](https://github.com/batect/batect/releases/tag/0.79.0) added publication of checksums for the wrapper scripts.
These checksums make it easy to verify the integrity of the wrapper scripts used in your project.

Verifying the integrity of the wrapper scripts in your project is important, as they could be maliciously modified and these modifications
may not be immediately apparent.

To make verifying your project's wrapper scripts even easier, I'm pleased to announce the release of the new
[batect-wrapper-validation-action action](https://github.com/batect/batect-wrapper-validation-action),
which validates the integrity of the wrapper scripts as part of a GitHub Actions workflow.

The [readme](https://github.com/batect/batect-wrapper-validation-action) has more details on how the action works and how to use it.
For most projects, it's as simple as adding the following job to an existing workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  validate-batect-wrapper:
    name: Validate Batect wrapper scripts
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04

    steps:
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4.1.0

      - name: Validate Batect wrapper scripts
        uses: batect/batect-wrapper-validation-action@v0.4.0
```

You can also use the action in an existing workflow or existing job.

:::warning
This action must run before any invocations of Batect.

If the action runs after an invocation of Batect and the wrapper script has been modified maliciously, the malicious version may be able to modify itself to appear genuine.
