As of today, Batect is no longer maintained.

Unfortunately, I no longer have the time to commit to maintaining Batect, and this situation is unlikely to change.

Any existing projects using Batect will continue to work.

Batect will no longer receive bug fixes, security fixes or new features, and I will not respond to issues, discussions, pull requests or emails related to Batect.

Thank you for all your support and enthusiasm for Batect over many years!
