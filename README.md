## Development

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), and, naturally, uses Batect to manage development
and testing tasks.

Run `./batect --list-tasks` to see available tasks such as setting up a fresh clone, building the site, serving it locally
and checking for broken links or formatting issues.

To run the site locally while editing:

* Run `./batect setup` to download dependencies
* Run `./batect start` to compile the website, then visit http://localhost:3000 to preview the site
