title: Shell tab completion
---

Shell tab completion makes it faster to work with Batect. Rather than having to remember [CLI options](../reference/cli.mdx) or task names, you can type the
start of the name, press <kbd>Tab</kbd>, and the name will be filled in for you automatically.

For example, typing `./batect --he`<kbd>Tab</kbd> completes to `./batect --help` and typing `./batect bui`<kbd>Tab</kbd> completes to `./batect build`.

Batect supports shell tab completion in [Bash](#bash), [Fish](#fish) and [Zsh](#zsh).
