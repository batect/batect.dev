:::note
This page reflects the options available in the [most recent version](https://github.com/batect/batect/releases/latest)
of Batect.

If you are not running the most recent version, run `./batect --help` to see what options are available in your version.
:::

## Run a task

Run a task by running `./batect <task-name>`. For example, to run `the-task`, run `./batect the-task`.

### Pass additional arguments to a task

You can also pass arguments to the task command by passing those arguments by running `./batect <task-name> -- <args...>`.
For example, to run the task `the-task` with the arguments `arg1 arg2`, run `./batect the-task -- arg1 arg2`.

### `--cache-type`

By default, Batect will use a Docker volume for each [cache](../concepts/caches.md) for Linux containers.
Use this option to instruct Batect to use a different storage mechanism.

Supported values are:

- `volume`: use Docker volumes
- `directory`: use directories mounted from the project's `.batect/caches` directory

The `BATECT_CACHE_TYPE` environment variable can also be used to set the default cache type. If both the environment
variable and the `--cache-type` option are set, the value given with `--cache-type` takes precedence.

:::info
This option has no effect on Windows containers. Windows containers always use directory mounts for caches.
:::

Example:

```shell
./batect --cache-type=directory the-task
```

### `--clean`

Running `./batect --clean` will remove all caches created for this project.

This command respects the value of the [`--cache-type`](#--cache-type) option and the `BATECT_CACHE_TYPE` environment variable.

Use [`--clean-cache`](#--clean-cache) to remove specific caches rather than all caches.

### `--clean-cache`

Running `./batect --clean-cache=<cache name>` will remove the named cache for this project.

This option can be provided multiple times, for example: `./batect --clean-cache=cache-1 --clean-cache=cache-2` or `./batect --clean-cache=cache-1,cache-2`
will both remove the `cache-1` and `cache-2` caches.

This command respects the value of the [`--cache-type`](#--cache-type) option and the `BATECT_CACHE_TYPE` environment variable.

Use [`--clean`](#--clean) to remove all caches.

### `--config-file` or `-f`

By default, Batect will use a configuration file called `batect.yml` in the current directory.
Use this option to instruct Batect to use a different file.

Example:

```shell
./batect --config-file my-other-config-file.yml the-task
```

### `--config-vars-file`

By default, Batect will automatically apply values for [config variables](config/config-variables.md) from the YAML file `batect.local.yml`
if it exists.

Use `--config-vars-file` to specify a different file to use instead of `batect.local.yml`.

Values provided with [`--config-var`](#--config-var) take precedence over values provided in any file.

Example:

```shell
./batect --config-vars-file batect.ci.yml the-task
```

Example `batect.ci.yml` contents:

```yaml
log_level: debug
user_name: alex
```

### `--config-var`

Use `--config-vars` to specify values for an individual [config variable](config/config-variables.md).

Values must be in the format `<variable name>=<variable value>`.

Values provided with `--config-var` take precedence over values provided in a file (either explicitly with
[`--config-vars-file`](#--config-vars-file) or from the default `batect.local.yml` file)
and default values defined in the configuration file.

Example:

```shell
./batect --config-var log_level=debug the-task
```

### `--disable-ports`

By default, Batect binds ports from containers to the host machine running Batect. These are defined with [`ports`](config/containers.md#ports) on the container or [`ports`](config/tasks.md#ports) on the task.

However, in some situations, it can be useful to disable these bindings. In particular, when running multiple tasks in parallel, such as on CI systems, host port bindings can result in conflicts.

Passing `--disable-ports` disables all port bindings for all containers. This includes port bindings defined at the task level.

Example:

```shell
./batect --disable-ports the-task
```

### `--docker-cert-path`, `--docker-tls-ca-cert`, `--docker-tls-cert` and `--docker-tls-key`

If your Docker daemon requires TLS, Batect needs three files in order to connect to it:

- the CA certificate that can be used to verify certificates presented by the Docker daemon (`--docker-tls-ca-cert`)
- the certificate that can be used to prove your identity to the Docker daemon (`--docker-tls-cert`) and corresponding private key (`--docker-tls-key`)

By default, these files are stored in [the Docker client configuration directory](#--docker-config) and are named `ca.pem`, `cert.pem` and `key.pem` respectively.

You can instruct Batect use a non-default location for any of these files with the options mentioned above, or override the default directory for these
files with `--docker-cert-path`. If the `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` environment variable is set, Batect will use that as the default directory, or otherwise
use the value specified with `--docker-config` / `DOCKER_CONFIG`.

If both `--docker-cert-path` (or `DOCKER_CERT_PATH`) and a path for an individual file is provided, the path for the individual file takes precedence.

These options mirror the behaviour of the `docker` CLI's `--tlscacert`, `--tlscert` and `--tlskey` options.

:::info
These options only apply if the `default` Docker CLI context is in use. See [Docker daemon connection settings](#docker-daemon-connection-settings)
for further explanation.
:::

### `--docker-config`

By default, Batect will look for Docker client configuration files in the directory provided by the `DOCKER_CONFIG` environment variable,
or `~/.docker` if `DOCKER_CONFIG` is not set. Use this option to instruct Batect to use a different directory.

Example:

```shell
./batect --docker-config ~/.my-other-docker-config the-task
```

### `--docker-context`

The Docker CLI context to retrieve Docker daemon connection settings from.

By default, Batect will use the active context set with `docker context use`, or the context from the `DOCKER_CONTEXT`
environment variable.

Example:

```shell
./batect --docker-context colima the-task
```

This option mirrors the behaviour of the `docker` CLI's `--context` option.

:::info
Other Docker daemon connection options such as `--docker-host` and `--docker-tls` only apply if the `default` Docker CLI context is in use.
See [Docker daemon connection settings](#docker-daemon-connection-settings) for further explanation.
:::

### `--docker-host`

By default, Batect will connect to the Docker daemon using the path provided in the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable, or
the default path for your operating system if `DOCKER_HOST` is not set. Use this option to instruct Batect to use a different path.

Example:

```shell
./batect --docker-host unix:///var/run/other-docker.sock the-task
```

:::info
This option only applies if the `default` Docker CLI context is in use. See [Docker daemon connection settings](#docker-daemon-connection-settings)
for further explanation.
:::

### `--docker-tls` and `--docker-tls-verify`

By default, the Docker daemon only accepts plaintext connections from the local machine. If your daemon requires TLS, use the `--docker-tls-verify` option
to instruct Batect to use TLS. Batect will also automatically enable this option if the `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY` environment variable is set to `1`.

If your daemon presents a certificate that does not match its hostname, use the `--docker-tls` option (without `--docker-tls-verify`) to instruct
Batect to not verify the hostname.

:::warning
Using `--docker-tls` without `--docker-tls-verify` is insecure and should only be used if you understand the implications of this.
:::

These options mirror the behaviour of the `docker` CLI's `--tls` and `--tlsverify` options.

:::info
These options only apply if the `default` Docker CLI context is in use. See [Docker daemon connection settings](#docker-daemon-connection-settings)
for further explanation.
:::

### `--enable-buildkit`

:::caution
Support for BuildKit in Batect is considered experimental. Please [file an issue](https://github.com/batect/batect/issues) if you encounter any problems.
:::

By default, Batect will use the legacy builder to build Docker images. Docker recently introduced a new image builder, BuildKit, that offers
improved performance and some new features.

Use this option to instruct Batect to use BuildKit to build images, rather than the legacy image builder.

Example:

```shell
./batect --enable-buildkit the-task
```

Batect will automatically enable this flag if the `DOCKER_BUILDKIT` environment variable is set to `1` or `true`.

Note that BuildKit is only supported on Docker 18.09 or later, or on earlier versions when Docker is running with
[experimental features enabled](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#description).

### `--help` or `-h`

Running `./batect --help` will show a summary of the options available on the command line.

### `--list-tasks` or `-T`

Batect can produce a short summary of all tasks in the current configuration file along with their
[`description`](config/tasks.md#description), and grouped by their [`group`](config/tasks.md#group).

For example, `./batect --list-tasks` produces output like this:

```text
Build tasks:
- build: Build the application.

Test tasks:
- continuousUnitTest: Run the unit tests in watch mode.
- unitTest: Run the unit tests once.

Utility tasks:
- outdated: Check for outdated dependencies.
- shell: Start a shell in the development environment.
```

When combined with [`--output=quiet`](#--output-or--o), Batect produces output suitable for parsing by other applications.
Tasks are listed in alphabetical order, with one task per line. Each task is followed by a tab character, then
its description.

For example, `./batect --list-tasks --output=quiet` produces output like this:

```text
build    Build the application.
continuousUnitTest    Run the unit tests in watch mode.
unitTest    Run the unit tests once.
outdated    Check for outdated dependencies.
shell    Start a shell in the development environment.
```

### `--log-file`

Use this option to instruct Batect to generate a debugging log at the specified path as it runs. This may be requested if you submit an issue.

If the log file already exists, Batect will append further log messages to the end of the file.

Example:

```shell
./batect --log-file /tmp/debugging-log.json the-task
```

### `--max-parallelism`

By default, Batect will try to run all setup and cleanup steps in parallel, as described in [the task lifecycle](../concepts/task-lifecycle.mdx).
On some machines, this can overwhelm the Docker daemon, leading to timeouts and other issues. Use this option to limit the number of setup or cleanup steps to run in parallel.

Note that this does not limit the number of containers that can run in parallel.

Example:

```shell
./batect --max-parallelism=4 the-task
```

### `--no-color`

By default, Batect will produce coloured output if it detects that your console supports it. However, sometimes Batect may incorrectly
believe your console supports coloured output, or your console may incorrectly report that it supports coloured output when it does not.
(This is a common issue with some CI systems.) This can lead to garbled or difficult to read output.

Passing this flag will disable all coloured output, even if Batect believes your console supports it.

Example:

```shell
./batect --no-color the-task
```

### `--no-cleanup`, `--no-cleanup-after-failure` and `--no-cleanup-after-success`

By default, Batect will automatically cleanup all containers and other resources it creates while running a task.
However, sometimes it can be useful to leave all the created containers running to diagnose issues running a task.

- Use `--no-cleanup-after-failure` to not clean up if any task fails to start for any reason.
- Use `--no-cleanup-after-success` to not clean up the containers and other resources created for the main task (the one specified on the command line) if it succeeds.
- Use `--no-cleanup` to enable both of the above.

Example:

```shell
./batect --no-cleanup-after-failure the-task
```

### `--no-proxy-vars`

By default, Batect will automatically propagate proxy-related environment variables as described [here](../how-to/proxies.mdx).
Use this option to disable this behaviour.

Example:

```shell
./batect --no-proxy-vars the-task
```

### `--no-telemetry`

If you would like to disable [telemetry collection](/privacy#in-app-telemetry) or uploading for a single invocation of Batect, pass the `--no-telemetry` flag.

By default, Batect uses the permission you granted it when it ran for the first time.

Example:

```shell
./batect --no-telemetry the-task
```

Note that this does not cause any data that has been collected from other invocations but not uploaded to be removed - it will be uploaded the next time
Batect runs without the `--no-telemetry` flag. To disable telemetry permanently and remove any collected data pending upload, use
[`--permanently-disable-telemetry`](#--permanently-disable-telemetry).

You can also disable telemetry collection and reporting in other ways:

- set the `BATECT_ENABLE_TELEMETRY` environment variable to `false`
- set [`forbid_telemetry`](/docs/reference/config#forbid_telemetry) to `true` in your project's configuration file

### `--no-update-notification`

Batect automatically checks for updates at most once every 24 hours and displays a notification if a newer version is available.

Passing this flag will disable both the update check and notification.

This flag is automatically enabled if [`--output`](#--output-or--o) is set to `quiet`.

### `--no-wrapper-cache-cleanup`

Batect automatically removes old versions of itself that have been downloaded and cached locally if they haven't been used in 30 days.

Passing this flag will disable this cleanup process. You can manually remove these files from `~/.batect/cache` yourself at any time.

### `--override-image`

By default, Batect will use the image defined in the configuration file (either with [`image`](config/containers.md#image) or [`build_directory`](config/containers.md#build_directory)).

Use this option to override the value in the configuration file and use a different image for a specific container.

Values must be in the format `<container name>=<image>`.

Example:

```shell
./batect --override-image build-env=ruby:2.7.0 the-task
```

### `--output` or `-o`

Batect offers four styles of output:

- `fancy` is best for interactive use, providing very clean output about the current state of execution and showing output from only the task container

  <AsciinemaPlayer
    src={require("../assets/outputstyles/fancy.cast").default}
    width={204}
    height={20}
    preload={true}
    poster="npt:2.5"
  />

- `simple` is best for non-interactive use (eg. on CI), providing a log of what happened and showing output from only the task container

  <AsciinemaPlayer
    src={require("../assets/outputstyles/simple.cast").default}
    width={204}
    height={20}
    preload={true}
    poster="npt:2.5"
  />

- `all` displays output from all containers

  <AsciinemaPlayer
    src={require("../assets/outputstyles/interleaved.cast").default}
    width={204}
    height={20}
    preload={true}
    poster="npt:4"
  />

- `quiet` displays only the output from the task and error messages from Batect

  <AsciinemaPlayer
    src={require("../assets/outputstyles/quiet.cast").default}
    width={204}
    height={20}
    preload={true}
    poster="npt:7"
  />

There are some differences between these output styles to be aware of:

| Output style                 | `fancy`                                                  | `simple`                                        | `quiet`                     | `all`                                           |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Progress information         | Detailed (eg. download % completed, health check status) | Basic (eg. image pull started, container ready) | Errors only                 | Basic (eg. image pull started, container ready) |
| Displays output from         | Task container only                                      | Task container only                             | Task container only         | All containers                                  |
| stdin connected (if present) | Yes, to task container only                              | Yes, to task container only                     | Yes, to task container only | No                                              |
| TTY connected (if present)   | Yes, to task container only                              | Yes, to task container only                     | Yes, to task container only | No                                              |
| Image build output shown     | Only on build failure                                    | Only on build failure                           | Only on build failure       | Always                                          |

By default, Batect will automatically pick an output style that it believes is appropriate for the environment it is running in -
`fancy` if it believes your environment supports it, or `simple` otherwise.

Passing this flag allows you to override what Batect believes is appropriate.

Example:

```shell
./batect --output simple the-task
```

Passing `--output=quiet` implies [`--no-update-notification`](#--no-update-notification).

Passing `--output=quiet` also modifies the output of [`--list-tasks`](#--list-tasks-or--t)
to make it easier to parse with other applications.

### `--permanently-disable-telemetry`

If you would like to opt-out of [telemetry](/privacy#in-app-telemetry), run `./batect --permanently-disable-telemetry` to disable collecting telemetry data and
remove any data that has been collected but not yet uploaded.

This also resets your telemetry user ID, ensuring that if you do ever re-enable telemetry, any previous data uploaded is not associated with any
new data.

You can also disable telemetry collection and reporting in other ways:

- set the `BATECT_ENABLE_TELEMETRY` environment variable to `false`
- set [`forbid_telemetry`](/docs/reference/config#forbid_telemetry) to `true` in your project's configuration file
- use [`--no-telemetry`](#--no-telemetry) to disable telemetry for a single invocation of `./batect`

### `--permanently-enable-telemetry`

If you would like to opt-in to [telemetry](/privacy#in-app-telemetry), run `./batect --permanently-enable-telemetry` to enable collecting telemetry data.

### `--skip-prerequisites`

Normally, Batect will run all tasks defined as [prerequisites](config/tasks.md#prerequisites) for the task given on the command line, before then
running the requested task.

Use this option to run only the requested task.

Example:

```shell
./batect --skip-prerequisites the-task
```

### `--tag-image`

Batect automatically tags images [built](config/containers.md#build_directory) for containers with a name based on the [project name](config/overview.md#project_name) and container name.

Use `--tag-image` to add additional tags to the built image. This tag can then be used to then push the image to a remote registry with `docker push`, or to ensure that subsequent task invocations
use exactly the same image with [`--override-image`](#--override-image).

Values must be in the format `<container name>=<image>`, for example:

```shell
./batect --tag-image build-env=my-build-env:v1.2.3 the-task
```

Tags can include remote registries, for example:

```shell
./batect --tag-image build-env=docker-images.mycompany.com/my-build-env:v1.2.3 the-task
```

Multiple tags can be applied to the same built image by giving `--tag-image` multiple times, for example:

```shell
./batect --tag-image build-env=my-build-env:v1 --tag-image build-env=my-build-env:v1.2.3 the-task
```

:::caution
`--tag-image` can't be used with containers that pull images directly with [`image`](config/containers.md#image).
:::

### `--use-network`

By default, Batect will create a new Docker network for each task, as described in [the task lifecycle](../concepts/task-lifecycle.mdx).
Use this option to provide an existing network to use for all tasks.

Example:

```shell
./batect --use-network=my-existing-network the-task
```

### `--upgrade`

Running `./batect --upgrade` will automatically upgrade Batect in the current project to the latest
available version.

### `--version`

Running `./batect --version` will show a summary of the versions of Batect, Docker and your operating
system, which can be useful when diagnosing issues with Batect.

## Docker daemon connection settings

In order for Batect to communicate with a Docker daemon, it needs two key pieces of information: the host and any TLS-related
connection settings.

These settings can come either from the `default` Docker CLI context, or another context. A context contains all of the information
Batect needs to communicate with a Docker daemon.

### Context precedence

Batect follows the same logic as the `docker` CLI tool when determining which context to use, with scenarios at the top of
the following list having higher precedence:

- If the [`--docker-context`](#--docker-context) option is provided, that context is used
- If the [`--docker-host`](#--docker-host) option is provided, the `default` context is used
- If the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable is set, the `default` context is used
- If the `DOCKER_CONTEXT` environment variable is set, that context is used
- If there is an active context previously selected with `docker context use`, that context is used
- Otherwise, the `default` context is used

### `default` context

The `default` context is unlike other contexts in that it is dynamic: it respects options set on the command line
or through environment variables, and falls back to Docker's default settings if neither of these sources have been
set.

For example, if the [`--docker-host`](#--docker-host) option is provided, the `default` context will use the host from
that option. If the option is not provided, it will use the value of the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable if set.
Otherwise, if option is not provided and the environment variable is not set, the `default` context will fall back to
the default value appropriate for the current operating system (eg. `unix:///var/run/docker.sock` on macOS and Linux).

### Other contexts

Other contexts ignore command line options and environment variables and use only the settings stored in the context.

These settings can be viewed with `docker context inspect <name>` (eg. `docker context inspect colima`), and modified
with `docker context update`.

A list of available contexts can be viewed with `docker context ls`, and a new context can be created with `docker context create`.
